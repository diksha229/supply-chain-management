# supply-chain-management
I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to track key supply chain metrics like inventory levels, order fulfillment, and delivery performance. The goal was to help businesses identify bottlenecks, improve efficiency, and make data-driven decisions in real time.

# Objectives 
* To visualize and monitor key supply chain KPIs such as inventory status, order fulfillment rates, and delivery timelines for better operational transparency.

* To identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the supply chain process through interactive charts and real-time data insights.

* To support data-driven decision-making by providing stakeholders with a user-friendly dashboard that highlights trends, delays, and performance metrics.
